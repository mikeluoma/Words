/**
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * Please solve the following problem:
 * Given a function that returns if a string is a word, ie dictionary.isWord("");,
 * can you write a function to determine if a given string is composed entirely of words?
 *   This means that each of the letters is used once, in order, to create words.
 *   ie "thisisawesome" should return true because each letter is used once ie "this is awesome"
 *   "thisisawesomez", "zasdf", "the2" should return false
